Web scraping is a powerful method for collecting stock data directly from financial websites. This process involves using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup,
Scrapy, or Selenium to automate the extraction of data, such as stock prices, trading volume, P/E ratios, and historical performance, from public financial pages.
